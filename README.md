# 🌐 Juan's Journey from Chef to Web Dev 👨‍🍳➡️👨‍💻

Welcome to my personal website! This is a space where I share my story, projects, and passion for all things **web development** and **creativity**.

## 📄 About Me
👋 Hey there! I'm **Juan**, originally from sunny **Madrid, Spain** 🇪🇸. In 2012, I packed my bags and landed in vibrant **London** 🇬🇧, ready for a new adventure.

Check out the [About Me](#about) section to see how my journey began!

## 💻 Why I Chose Web Development

I was looking for a career where I could mix **creativity** 🎨 with **technical problem-solving** 🔧. I discovered web development and fell in love with it.

Here are a couple of my early projects:
- 🎮 [ProjectVideoGame](https://juangalbea.github.io/ProjectVideoGame/)
- 🕹️ [GameFAC](https://juangalbea.github.io/GameFAC/)

> "The more I learned and built, the more I felt at home in this field."

## 🎓 My Education

🎵 Passionate about **music and sound**, I studied **Telecommunications Engineering** (Image & Sound). Later, I completed a Master's degree, where I created a video game for my final project using **Pure Data (PD)** 🎮.

Check out the **game gallery** in the [My Education](#engineer) section!

## 🍳 My Culinary Journey

Before diving into tech, I spent years cooking up magic in London’s kitchens—like **Jamie's Italian** and **Evolve Hospitality**.

Yes, I can **cook AND code**! 💥👨‍🍳👨‍💻
